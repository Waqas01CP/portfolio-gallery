# STATE

**Verified against commit 42f5760, the last commit before this file's
update, 2026-10-23 UTC, by the Brief 1 implementing session's thirteenth
round, under Brief 13 and its Addendum 1**: a fresh clone of it through
every check with axe, every defeat case with the browser and axe, the
cleanup, the deploy's own path with 13 real snips and every browser check
on what it assembled; the gates proven on a clone of it
(logs/2026-10-12-brief-1-build.md, Round 13). This is the only line in
this file that names commits.

This file is where to start, not where to stop. It outranks memory. It does
not outrank the code or the data: where a row disagrees with them, the row
is stale; report it and correct it.

Organised by task, not by session.

## How to read a row

STATUS is DONE, PARTIAL or PENDING. DONE only when built and exercised,
never when merely examined. Evidence is [VERIFIED] (exercised and
observed) or [BELIEVED] (reasoned from reading, not run). Proof is a
commit, a decision record or a log filename, never a file path.

## How to maintain it

Update the affected rows in the same commit as the work, or in the last
commit of a series (gate E checks the push). When a row becomes DONE, move
it to docs/reference/completed.md in the same commit. When a blocker
clears, remove it from Blocked and record the clearing in its row.

## Headline

Public, set up and tested; main changes only by pull request. The
showcase is live with the owner's own entry, its cards in their pictures'
own shapes, packed (pull request 14). The README routes every kind of
visitor and carries a checked prompt for their AI assistant, with the
Showcase entry and Question forms (pull request 15, ADR-0017); AGENTS.md
for coding agents, and a copy's own; a short prompt in a copy's README;
the gallery page's own picture leading the README (pull request 16). On
the branch copy-first-run-and-overlay, not yet pushed: a copy's first
Deploy ends with a notice, not red, while GitHub Pages is off, and the
copy's README leads with turning it on (ADR-0015, Changes, 2026-10-23);
a showcase card's larger copy opens in an overlay that can be closed
(ADR-0016, Changes, 2026-10-23). Waiting: the owner's merge, then a real
copy made by him to show the first run; step 5's policy, provable only on
or after 2026-11-02; ADR-0012, held.

## Publishing

| Task | Status | Evidence | Date | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| The Actions policy allowing `pull_request_target` (step 5) | PARTIAL | [BELIEVED] set by the owner (the chat's report); until 2026-11-02 GitHub runs the scope check without the policy too | 2026-10-18 | ADR-0006, A2; setup Test 1 |
| This branch, copy-first-run-and-overlay, merged to main | PENDING | the owner pushes it and opens the pull request; checks and scope must pass | 2026-10-23 | e459014, 42f5760 |

## Decisions waiting on the owner

| Task | Status | Evidence | Date | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lighthouse in CI | PENDING | held as proposed by the owner; speed measured locally | 2026-10-15 | ADR-0012 |

## Built, not yet complete

DONE rows are in docs/reference/completed.md.

| Task | Status | Evidence | Date | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CODEOWNERS and the issue templates | PARTIAL | [BELIEVED] written; not exercised until an outside contribution arrives | 2026-10-18 | b798834 |
| The showcase packed by its pictures' shapes | PARTIAL | [VERIFIED] the packing check at 390 and 1366 px, light and dark, by the script, by Chrome's grid-lanes and with scripts off, and its defeat cases, on a fresh clone, and on GitHub's runner in pull request 14's checks; [BELIEVED] in Safari 26.4's own grid-lanes, which the seat cannot run | 2026-10-22 | b17d883, ba93032; ADR-0016, Changes |
| The README's routes and prompt; the Showcase entry and Question forms | PARTIAL | [VERIFIED] the prompt check and its defeat cases; on main, GitHub's own page serves the prompt's block with its copy button's text and the three pictures through its image proxy (2026-10-23); the forms parsed; [BELIEVED] the four forms in the issue chooser, which needs a sign-in, until the owner looks | 2026-10-23 | 0ce2c71, pull request 15; ADR-0017 |
| A copy's first Deploy with GitHub Pages off: a notice, not red; the README's lead | PARTIAL | [VERIFIED] the pages step against a fake GitHub API, the workflow check's wiring and table, the prompt check on the README's lead, and their defeat cases, on a fresh clone; [BELIEVED] on GitHub, until the owner's real copy after the merge shows the first run's notice and then a publish | 2026-10-23 | e459014; ADR-0015, Changes |
| The showcase's overlay | PARTIAL | [VERIFIED] the overlay check at 390 and 1366 px, light and dark, axe open and closed, with scripts off, and its defeat cases; the tree at load the same as main's; [BELIEVED] in Safari and Firefox, whose dialog the seat cannot run | 2026-10-23 | 42f5760; ADR-0016, Changes |

## Blocked, and on whom

| Item | Blocked on | Who | Since |
|---|---|---|---|
| Step 5's proof | The date: Test 1 again on or after 2026-11-02 | The owner | 2026-10-18 |
| Merging this branch | The owner's push, the pull request and the merge | The owner | 2026-10-23 |
| A copy's first run on GitHub | A real copy, made by the owner after the merge, with the steps in the chat's report | The owner, then the chat | 2026-10-23 |

## Known unverified

- Whether GitHub accepts the two issue forms added on 2026-10-22; one it
  cannot read shows an error in the issue chooser, which needs a sign-in.
- Whether a copy's own token, with Pages: read, gets a 404 from GitHub's
  API while Pages is off, as the documentation's table implies, rather
  than another answer, which would fail the run; the owner's real copy
  shows it.
- Whether coding agents follow AGENTS.md as their documentation says;
  read from first-party documentation, not tried with each agent.
- How Safari 26.4 and later, the one browser shipping grid-lanes, packs
  the cards; Chrome's own grid-lanes, behind its flag, matched the
  script's places within 1 px on 2026-10-21.
- Whether a Mac's own PNG encoder stays under the 20 MiB cap for a 5K
  wall of photographs; Chrome's encoder gave 9.5 MB and Windows' up to
  16.9 MB.
- Whether listed sites answer GitHub's runner as they answer this
  machine; bot protection answers some datacenter addresses with 403,
  which the check reports for a check by hand.
- Whether a template copy shows a link back to its template on GitHub.
- Whether the step 5 policy lets the scope check run once GitHub enforces
  its block, from 2026-11-02.
- Whether Chrome runs on the runner with its sandbox; it runs with
  --no-sandbox, as the workflows set (ADR-0010, A3).
- Why a panel hidden by script without aria-hidden was exposed at load on
  the owner's site at 0403c68 but not on this engine.
- The cause of the default design's rare anchor misses with swap (font
  timing is a hypothesis; optional removed them, ADR-0014).
